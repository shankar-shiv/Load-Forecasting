# An introduction to Load Forecasting

In a distribution network, there are a large number of loads and the energy consumption of each load is comparatively low.

Thus, it is exhaustive and expensive to monitor the load consumption of each and every load.

The solution is to predict the load consumption for use in both operation and further planning of a distribution system.

## 3 forecasting time zones

Load forecasting can be divided into 3 time divisions, they are,

- Short-Term load forecasting : 1 hour to 1 week
- Medium-Term load forecasting : 1 week to 1 year
- Long-Term load forecasting : Time duration is longer than a year

## Techniques to predict load forecasting

There are many ways to predict in short term they are as follows,

- Linear/Non linear Regression
- Classification ->
- Clustering ->
